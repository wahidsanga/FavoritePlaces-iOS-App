# ``FavouritePlaces``

An application called FavouritePlaces to keep a list of favourite places, including detailed information and a picture.

## Overview

The purpose of this milestone to create an advanced Master/Detail app with persistent data using CoreData.  the App runs on iOS in the simulator on the lab computers.  The goal of the App is to keep a list of my favourite places, including detailed information and a picture. A Master/Detail view is implemented with persistent data. The Master View displays a list of (any number) of places.  Each entry in the list (item) shows a thumbnail preview of the image of the place and the name of the place. The Master View is fully editable, i.e., you can add, remove, and edit elements.

The list is embedded in a Navigation View.   Each item is embedded in a Navigation Link to get to a Detail View by clicking (tapping) on the list item.  The Detail View shows the image (or its URL when in editing mode), the name, the location, and description.  All elements including the image URLs and description is fully editable.  The Detail View also has a back button (typically displaying the name of the list) at the top left that takes the user back to the Master View.
