# ``FavouritePlaces``

An application called FavouritePlaces to keep a list of favourite places, including detailed information and a picture.

## Overview

The purpose of this milestone is to add an interactive map to the FavouritePlaces project to incorporate an online map services.  The goal of the App is to keep a list of my favourite places, including detailed information and a picture. A Master/Detail view is implemented with persistent data. The Master View displays a list of (any number) of places. A location name for each place in displayed in the app, along with its geographical coordinates. A navigation link to the detail view leads to display the full information of that location, which includes the name of the location, its coordinates, as well as an interactive map showing the location in the MapView UI file. The map updates whenever the coordinates of the location is changed, and also the user is allowed to change the location (coordinates) interactively through the map.  

Other requirements covered were:
-Use a local Git repository for version control. Use of best practice and committing early and often (is done. Also the submission is tagged as milestone2.
-The Principle of Separation of Concerns is followed, i.e. separate code that deals with different things into different files and types (e.g. Model, View, ViewModel, etc.) has been implemented.
-Serialisation (loading and saving) is done using CoreData as the main persistence protocol for this milestone.
-When there are no saved data, the list contains at least three complete demo entries as default data.
-Use of best practice when designing the User Interfaces is done. E.g. the user interface works on differently sized devices, with relevant font settings, emphasis, spacing, separators, drop shadows.

## Topics

In the Second milestone, I have learnt about:
- creation of interactive map
- updating and editing the coordinates in the map as required
