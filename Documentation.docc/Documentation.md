# ``FavouritePlaces``

An application called FavouritePlaces to keep a list of favourite places, including detailed information, a picture of a landmark in the place as well as an interactive map showing the location of the place.

## Overview

The purpose of this milestone is finalise the FavouritePlaces project to have a fully polished app that uses online location services, including geo-coding, reverse geo-coding, and sunrise/sunset times.  The App ensures that one can convert forwards and backwards between a location name and its geographical coordinates for each place in the app. A navigation link from the DetailView takes you to the MapView to display the full location information of that place, which includes the name of the location, its coordinates, as well as an interactive map showing the place. The map updates whenever the coordinates of the location change, as well as the user can change the coordinates interactively through the map.  The interactive map also enables the user to look up the coordinates for a given name as well as looking up a name for the selected coordinates. The app is fully polished and test data to test the data has also been added. 

Additional requirements covered are:

-Use a local Git repository for version control. Use of best practice and committing early and often (is done. Also the submission is tagged as milestone3.
-The Principle of Separation of Concerns is followed, i.e. separate code that deals with different things into different files and types (e.g. Model, View, ViewModel, etc.) has been implemented.
-Serialisation (loading and saving) is done using CoreData as the main persistence protocol for this milestone.
-Use of JSON through Codable for interacting with online location services that are not built into the iOS API is done.
-When there are no saved data, the list contains at least three complete demo entries as default data.
-Use of best practice when designing the User Interfaces is done. E.g. the user interface works on differently sized devices, with relevant font settings, emphasis, spacing, separators, drop shadows.
-A video link has been provided demonstrating the full working of the app along with unit testing.

## Topics

In the Third milestone, I have learnt about:
- creation of interactive map
- fetching data from API and formatting it and display sunrise and sunset time for a place.
- updating and editing the coordinates in the map as required
